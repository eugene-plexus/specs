"""Every GPU this machine has, asked of the operating system.

**Why this exists (2026-09-27).** An Intel Arc mini PC read "no GPU" on
alpha.3. The engine picker had already chosen the Vulkan build for it,
from `Win32_VideoController`'s names, but the device list asked only
`nvidia-smi`, `rocm-smi` and `xpu-smi` -- none of which a Windows machine
with an Arc or a Radeon has unless its owner installed a vendor SDK. So
the card that build was serving was invisible, and every fit on that
machine was scored against system RAM. The same held for every AMD card
on Windows, and on Linux for every AMD card without ROCm.

The operating system already knows every adapter, its vendor, whether
it is integrated, and how much memory it has and is using. That is one
mechanism for every vendor, and it needs nothing installed:

* **Windows: DXCore**, for the adapters (Windows 10 2004 and later), and
  the **`GPU Adapter Memory` performance counters** through PDH for how
  much of each is in use, system-wide. DXCore's own memory budget is the
  calling process's view, so it cannot say what other programs hold.
  Measured on the development box (an RTX 5090 beside an AMD integrated
  GPU): free memory from these two agreed with `nvidia-smi` to 18 MiB of
  32 GiB, and the AMD adapter reported itself integrated, with a 2 GiB
  carve-out and 75 GiB of shared memory.
* **Linux: sysfs**, `/sys/class/drm/card*/device`. amdgpu publishes VRAM
  and GTT totals and usage there. i915 and xe publish no memory figures
  this code knows, so an Intel card's size is reported as unknown.
  **The Linux half is unverified on real hardware**: it is written from
  the kernel's documented sysfs ABI.
* **macOS: Metal**, for the one device Apple silicon has and the share of
  unified memory Metal lets it hold (`metal_device`). Measured on GitHub's
  macOS runners (A4, 2026-09-30), where it matched MLX's own figure.

**This file is copied, not shared.** The agent and the library each keep
an identical copy, because components share schemas and not code. It
imports nothing but the standard library for that reason, and a change
to one copy is a change to both.

    `mx.device_info()` reports. So a small Mac was told a model fits that
    Metal will not hold. This reads the number the driver itself uses.

    Stdlib only: the Objective-C runtime through ctypes, every message sent
    through a prototype of its own, because `objc_msgSend` must not be
    called as a variadic function on arm64. CoreGraphics is loaded first,
    since a process that has not linked it can be given no default device.
    The work runs inside an autorelease pool, so the name string does not
    leak per call. None when any of it is missing; the caller falls back
    to a fraction of RAM and says so.
